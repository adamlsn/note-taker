  ## Usage

  ![./src/gifs/demo.gif](./src/gifs/demo.gif)
  
  The main usage of this product is that to save and retrieve simple JSON data. Each note is stored using an express `post` and is attached with a unique uuid. When the `delete` is called, the note with the attached unique uuid is spliced out of the JSON data. All links within the application are accessed through express routes.
